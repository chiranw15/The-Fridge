## The Fridge - React Task

Start by forking this repository as a **private repository**. 
When you're done, just push all the commits inside and send us a link to your Bitbucket repo. 

### Installation

First, install all dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Then setup our fridge:
```bash
yarn run setup
```

You can run this command once again when your fridge is full of stuff you don't want to eat.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You will see more info and the task itself in the application.
